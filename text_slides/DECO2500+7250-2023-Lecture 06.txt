What is Usability?
“The extent to which a product
•
can be used by specified users
to achieve specified goals, with
effectiveness, efficiency and
satisfaction in a specified
context of use. ” ISO 9421-11
Standard on Usability
“…Quite simply: if your
•
product is not usable, its UX
will be bad, and users will
leave you for your competitors.”
Interaction Design Foundation

Perspectives of Usability
•Whether users can complete their goals with
Effectiveness
a high degree of accuracy
Efficiency
•Is about speed. How fast? How many steps?
•Not just about looking nice but also looking
Engaging
right to the user and for the context
Error
•Ensure that a user can easily recover from
Tolerance an error and get to what she or he was doing.
•Users need to be able to learn how to use the
Easy to Learn
system easily - it is second nature

Metaphors
“A figure of speech in which a
•
word or phrase is applied to
an object or action to which it
is not literally applicable”
Oxford Dictionary
 E.g. “The toast jumped out of the
toaster”
Interface metaphors can help
•
the user understand the
interface

Interaction Metaphors
“Cognitive models for interaction that can
•
profoundly influence the design of interfaces
to data spaces” (Ware, 2013)
Used to communicate new ideas and help
•
people understand the type of interaction
that we expect to take place
Describe a pattern. Can classify patterns
•
and make them distinct from others
Communicate affordances – what an object
•
is, its purpose, and how people can interact
with it
Help novices become experts by helping
•
them relate it to the real world

dividing content into sections
Easy to Process
•
 Information can be communicated and
digested quickly
Visually Attractive
•
 Relies on images, which are attractive
and immediately catches the eye

assessment
It allows you to determine the MWL
•
of a participant while they are
performing a task
It rates performance across six
•
dimensions to determine an overall
workload rating

Chunking – Miller’s Law (1956)
The average person can only keep 7 (plus
•
or minus 2) items in their working
memory
 7 plus or minus 2 Rule
Chunking = The function of grouping
•
information together related by
perceptual features
Organize content into smaller chunks to
•
help users process, understand, and
memorize easily
Short-term memory capacity will vary
•
per individual, based on their prior
knowledge and situational context

NEW PAGE

Gestalt’s Theory
Conceived by German
•
psychologists, Max
Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka
Wolfgang Kohler and Christian
von Ehrenfels, in the 1920s
 Gestalt = 'shape' or 'form'
“The whole is other than the
•
sum of the parts” – Kurt Koffka
Our brains are built to see
•
structure and patterns in order
for us to better understand the
environment that we’re living
in

Gestalt’s Theory
27

NEW PAGE

Proximity and Similarity
Proximity
•
 The distance between objects in a display influences our perception of how objects are organized
 Things that are close together go together
 Similar information should be grouped together to simplify layouts and vice versa
Similarity
•
 Objects that look similar are perceived to be more related and are often are put together
 Can help to organise and categorise objects within a group (colour, size, shape, etc.)

NEW PAGE

Continuity and Closure
Continuity
•
 Items in a line or curve are thought to be more related
 When lines intersect we see two lines rather than four lines that join at a point
Closure
•
 Humans prefer complete shapes
 Any gaps are automatically filled in with bits that don’t exist to perceive a complete image
 This includes extending lines to form an unbroken object

NEW PAGE

Symmetry and Figure/Ground
Symmetry
•
 When humans see symmetrical items there is an assumption that a connection exists to form a
whole
 Complexity is reduced by parsing complex images into the simplest one
Figure/Ground
•
 Our minds separate images into a foreground (figure) and a background (ground)
 This results in one view becoming more overriding, while the other one will be harder to see
32

Common Fate
Common Fate
•
 When elements move towards the same direction they are thought of as being
more related
 Concerned with moving object (similar to proximity and similarity)
 Things that move with similar patterns are seen as being grouped

Hick’s Law
The time it takes for a person
•
to make a decision as a result
of the possible choices he or she
has
 Increasing the number of choices
will increase the decision time
logarithmically
The more choices that are
•
presented to a user, the longer
it takes them to make a
decision
Important for designers to not
•
overcomplicate and build too
much functionality into an
application

Examples of Hick’s Law
Instagram Double Tap:
The user has 3 major
choices with respect to the
content they see — Like it,
Comment on it and Share
it.
• Infinite scroll in
Instagram: An
abundance of
choices keeps the
user engaged in
its app for as long
as possible
42

NEW PAGE

Examples of Hick’s Law
Zomato ample choices:
the user is presented with
numerous choices, thereby
increasing the decision-
making time while
constantly exposing them to
food pictures
“The Top 10 in your
country” by Netflix:
People are inclined to make
decisions about watching
those shows in lesser time

Fitts’ Law
A model of human movement
•
that is used to accurately
predict the amount of time taken
to move to and select a target
Movement through a graphical
•
user interface
Gives us the relationship
•
between the time it takes a
pointer (such as a mouse cursor,
a human finger, or a hand) to
move to a particular target (e.g.,
physical or digital button, a
physical object) in order to
interact with it in some way
(e.g., by clicking or tapping it,
grasping it, etc.):

Fitts’ Law and UX: Optimizing Target
Size
Bigger Is Better:
•
 People will be faster to click, tap, or hover on bigger
targets
 Error rates go down as target sizes increases
Icons Plus Labels
•
 Text labels reduce icon ambiguity and makes it easy
to understand
 Improves movement time to that particular target
Padding Is Not Enough
•
 A padded target is usually a small target that has a
bigger invisible active area around it
 Padding will help prevent some overshooting errors
(if they realise it’s there)
47

NEW PAGE

Fitts’ Law and UX: Optimizing Target
Size
Infinite Targets Along Screen
•
Edges:
 The final-movement component can
be greatly reduced if the target is
very big — or even infinite
 Screen edges act as natural walls for
the cursor — as soon as the pointer
reaches an edge, it cannot move
beyond it, regardless of the speed
with which that wall has been hit.
Don’t Crowd Targets:
•
 Targets too close to each other is a
risk that people will accidentally
overshoot and accidentally trigger the
wrong target
 Especially likely to happen if the
targets are small.
48

NEW PAGE

Fitts’ Law and UX: Optimizing Distance
to Target
Menu Design:
•
 The average distance from menu handle to a menu element depends on
the type of menu
 Linear Menu: Items are arranged in a straight line
 Rectangular Menu: Items are arranged along both the horizontal and vertical
dimensions
 Pie Menu: All elements are placed on a circle around the handle and thus are
equally far away from the handle
49

NEW PAGE

Fitts’ Law and UX: Optimizing Distance
to Target
Linear Menu:
•
 The distance from the menu
handle to the first element is
the shortest
 The distance to the last
element in the menu is the
longest
 The average movement time
can be improved by aligning
the handle with the middle
of the menu
50

NEW PAGE

Fitts’ Law and UX: Optimizing Distance
to Target
Linear Menu:
•
In mobile devices, some
•
contextual menus show the
associated options in a
bottom sheet that appears
far away from the menu
label
This design is suboptimal,
•
since it forces the users to
waste movement time
Ideally, the options should
•
appear close to the label.

to Each Other:

Interaction Design Patterns
Interaction design patterns are an
•
important tool for knowledge sharing
Reusable/recurring components that
•
designers use to solve common
problems in user interface design
Users of the pattern can see the
•
problem and solution
Understand the context where the
•
idea has worked before
Access a rationale for why it worked
•
53

NEW PAGE

Interaction Design Patterns
A key feature of design patterns is
•
that they can be implemented in
many different ways
Design patterns are recurring
•
solutions that solve common design
problem that are a quick way to build
interfaces
Go Back to a Safe Place
•
 The "Home" button on a Web browser
 Provides a way to go back to a checkpoint

Consistency
Interfaces should be designed
•
to have similar operations
and use similar elements for
achieving similar tasks
A consistent interface follows
•
rules, such as using the same
operation to select all objects
Interfaces that are consistent
•
are easier to learn and use
Only a single mode of
•
operation has to be learned
that is applicable to all objects

the user interface by ONE other User-based class to your tutor
Week 7 and inform your evaluation method to (identity verified
tutor of your selection undertake assessment) – Hurdle:
students must achieve at
least a Pass (+/-) for the
critique portion of the
task to be eligible to pass
the entire assessment

Summary
Usability is part of a broader term of “user experience”
•
and refers to the ease of access and/or use of a product or
website
There isn’t just one perception of usability and no one is
•
the sole right one
Interface metaphors can help users understand the
•
interface by combining recognizable knowledge with new
knowledge
A number of laws and principles can be drawn upon from
•
cognitive science to increase the usability of software and
reduce cognitive load
