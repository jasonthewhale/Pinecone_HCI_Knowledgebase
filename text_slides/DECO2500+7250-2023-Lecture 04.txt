Representation
Form of the prototype
Off-line (paperprototypes)
• Sketches, storyboards, mock-ups,role-play
• Cheap& fast – can do many iterations at
low cost. Perfect for brainstorming

Representation
Form of the prototype
On-line(softwareprototypes)
• Partiallyimplementedor digitallymocked-up
• Animations,interactivevideo,scriptedapps
Representations
• Shouldsuitpurpose: should correspond to where you’re at in the
design process
• Allows to test the concept further, “more realistic setup”

Precision
Level of detail in the prototype
• Relevance of detail in the prototype
• Should suit purpose/goalof prototype
• Lessprecise ==more open fordiscussion

Interactivity
How much can the user do with the prototype
Fixed(video,animation, storyboard)
What willthe interaction looklike?

Evolution
The goal of a prototype (and to some extent stage in
process) willdictate:
its form(representation)
•
the level of detail(precision)
•
howmuchcontrol a user has overit (interactivity)
•
howlong it exists for(evolution)

Simulate:

Paradigms & Modes

NEW PAGE

Paradigms
“A model of something, or a very clear and typical
•
example of something” – Cambridge Dictionary
HCI history depicts a number of paradigm shifts
•
As new technology arrives, new insights into the
•
relationship between humans and computers are
created

Paradigms of Interaction
Informs design of a conceptual model

A particular philosophy or way of thinking about interaction design

computing manipulation everywhere real and
virtual worlds
collide

mobile hardware, and mobile software to allow
computers to be transported
Smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables, etc. all

require different design approaches

technology becomes almost
invisible in our lives
Ubiquitous computing is

the opposite of virtual
reality

Internet of Things
Allows objects to be networked
•
with unique addresses so that
they can interact with each other
and cooperate with their
neighbours to reach a common
goal
As more objects become internet-

enabled requires different design
approaches

Embodied Interaction
Tangible User Interfaces
•
 Digital information is interacted with through the
physical environment
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvtfD_rJ2hE&t=19s
Mixed reality
•
 Where the virtual and real world come together into
new visualizations to interact in real time (e.g.
Microsoft HoloLens)
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYdB2xBNFek
Virtual reality
•
 Immersive experience whereby a 3D computer
generated environment can be explored and interacted
with

Interaction Modes
Giving instructions
•
 Issuing commands using
keyboard and selecting options
via menus
Conversing
•
 Interacting with the system as if
having a conversation
Manipulating and navigating
•
 Acting on objects and interacting
with virtual objects
Exploring and browsing
•
 Finding out and learning things
44

Instructions
Shell command line interpreters for
•
operating systems
Command Prompt is available in most
•
Windows operating systems
The Linux operating system, first
•
released in 1991, mainly uses
command-line interfaces (CLI) or
graphical user interfaces (GUI)
Users interact with the computer via
•
The Shell
 Allows commands to be typed into a text
interface

Voice as an Input
Voice commands (instructions) are
•
issued to machines using Direct Voice
Input (DVI)
Speech recognition technology is easy to
•
use and readily available
Downsides include inaccuracy due to
•
ambient noise and variations in
pronunciation
Designing for a system that doesn’t
•
have an interface is a new challenge

Sign Language as an Input
Sign language technologies are often Disability
•
Dongles
 A well intended elegant, yet useless solution to a problem we
never knew we had – Liz Jackson (Founding Member
@DisabledListOrg)
Listen to your prospective users
•
Work with end users in your projects, especially those
•
with a disability and people from cultural and
linguistic minorities
Work on projects those with a disability want
•
worked on
“The solutions proposed by signed language recognition
•
and other similar technologies (e.g. signed language
gloves, avatars) are generally not feasible, because they
are also based on naïve understandings of what deaf
community signed languages are and how they work, or
even the realistic needs and desires of deaf and hard of
hearing signers striving for improved communication
access.” Dr Gabrielle Hodge, Deaf academic, UCL

Sign Language as an Input
The Auslan Communication Technologies Pipeline (Auslan CTP) project by Dr
•
Jessica Korte (UQ/AQ TAS DCRC Fellow)
“[The project] is a proposed AI-based language technology for Auslan
•
(Australian Sign Language). I like to think of it as creating a prototype “Alexa
for Auslan”. It is being developed using a participatory, human-centred design
approach” Dr Jessica Korte
A human-centred design approach has been applied to the Auslan CTP
•
project that involves potential users in the design process
 Known philosophy of design approaches, including participatory design, celebrates
that real users have abilities and insights that developers may not be aware of

Manipulating and Navigating
Replicating the sense of touch within
•
virtual technologies is seen as a new
challenge
Haptics is an emerging research area
•
that allows touch‐enabled interaction
with virtual objects
 Gloves are often used as input devices
Objects can also be manipulated on
•
mobile devices via pinching and
spreading gestures

Exploring and Browsing
Involves moving through virtual

environments
A cave automatic virtual environment

(CAVE) system is an immersive
virtual reality environment that users
navigate through
Can be enhanced with sound, video

and haptic feedback (force feedback
vibrations)

Interaction Analysis
What the user will be doing
•
when carrying out the task?
 E.g. searching information,
exploring a virtual environment,
etc.
What interaction mode(s) are
•
best suited for the task?
Any other constraints?
•
 E.g. budget, suitability of the
technology for the activity

Summary
Interaction types provide a way of thinking about
•
how best to support the activities users will be doing
when using a product or service
 These lists are not exclusive or exhaustive
They give you ways of thinking about the solution
•
space to the problems you have identified
This is a design process and therefore one of creation
•
Not simply the case of crank the handle, follow the
•
process and tick the boxes
