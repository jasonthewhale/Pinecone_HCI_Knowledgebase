Academic Integrity
Ignorance can result in plagiarism/misconduct through:
•
 Working too closely with other students
 Failing to reference properly
 Submitting the same work to multiple courses
 Ignorance is not a defense!
Solutions:
•
 Complete your assignments separately to other people
 If quoting directly use “ ” and always reference
 Check with the teaching team and/or UQ guidelines if unsure
 Get familiar with Academic Integrity at UQ
Don’t risk getting on the academic misconduct register
•
ITEE expects all students to know the following:

Benefits of Academic Integrity
High standards of academic integrity protect you, the University
•
and the community:
 You have the pride and confidence that comes with knowing you have
developed your knowledge and learnt new skills
 You understand how new knowledge is created and how to apply that
knowledge to your studies and future career
 You model the practices of integrity we want for society
 The community has faith in the value of a UQ qualification
 Your employer, your clients and your patients know you are knowledgeable
and skilled

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Generative AI tools create content based on a text
•
prompt, including images, code and text
Recent releases (particularly ChatGPT released
•
in late Nov 2022) have made significant advances
in the quality of text-based content produced
Generative AI are now powerful tools but have a
•
range of limitations. The ChatGPT system
acknowledges it:
 May occasionally generate incorrect information
 May occasionally produce harmful instructions or
biased content
 Limited knowledge of world and events after 2021
At UQ, the assessment you submit must be

Generative AI in Assessments
Use of generative AI in any assessment is not
•
permitted.
You will not be permitted to use
•
generative AI tools in any
assessment task in this course
 Check what is appropriate for each
course you are enrolled in
Attempted use of AI in these
•
tasks may constitute student
misconduct under the (PPL
3.60.01) Student Code of
Conduct.

Introduction to HCI
22

NEW PAGE

What is HCI?
Focused on developing first-hand understanding of users
•
 Study of the interaction between humans (users) and computers
Definition of HCI is quite broad
•
 Covers almost all forms of information technology (IT)
HCI is the study of designing computers and machines so that
•
they best serve their users (i.e. humans)
23

NEW PAGE

What is HCI?
Closely related to the field of User Experience (UX) design
•
The user interface is where the interaction between humans and
•
computers occurs
 Includes both software and hardware
HCI investigates, develops, and harnesses new areas of possibility,
•
not just as technologies or designs, as means for enhancing human
activity and experience
24

NEW PAGE

Why is HCI important?
HCI is the study of how computers and machines can
•
better help us
Invaluable in making sure that computers are
•
designed for successful and intuitive human use

Goals of HCI
Produce usable, safe and functional
•
systems
To produce systems with good
•
usability, developers must attempt
to:
 Understand the factors that determine
how people use technology
 Develop tools and techniques to enable
building suitable systems
 Achieve efficient, effective, and safe
interaction
 Put people first

HCI • Study of designing,

use and are affected by
computers • Methods and tools
for general software
•Draws on knowledge
and skills from development based
psychology, sociology on engineering

• Concerned with "how in computer science

• Concerned with "how
software is
constructed"

NEW PAGE

Interaction Design
Interaction design is the design
•
of the interaction between
users and products
Aim is to create products that
•
enable the user to achieve their
goals in the best way possible
Users are involved throughout
•
the development of the project
Design is about balancing
•
trade offs and generating
alternative solutions
 Cost vs. effectiveness
 Time vs. budget
34

NEW PAGE

The Interaction Design Process
• Understand what is needed
Requirements
• Interview, ethnography
• Research, scenarios, task analysis
Analysis
• Create wireframes, flows, etc.
Design
• Guideline principles
• Refine design
Prototyping
• Evaluation heuristics
• Build and deploy the system
Implementation
• Documentation
• Determine usability and acceptability with
Evaluate
real users

The Importance of Involving Users
Is vital in order to better understand the users’
•
requirements and to manage expectations
Users are involved in the design process as active
•
stakeholders
Errors are corrected earlier
•
Higher user acceptance
•
Adopting a user-centred approach
•
 Early focus on users and tasks
 Empirical measurements – reactions/performance to scenarios
 Iterative design – problems are identified, fixed and tested
37

NEW PAGE

Interaction Design Issues
Understanding and supporting human activity away
•
from the workplace
Implicit input
•
Output on different scales
•
 Inch, foot, yard
Integrated digital and physical worlds
•
Understanding, representing, and developing
•
technology that supports context
38

NEW PAGE

Summary
Technology is increasingly embedded in the world around us and is
•
still driving the agenda
Interactive technology is more than just windows, a keyboard and
•
mouse
Pervasive/ubiquitous computing implies a shift in focus away from
•
workplace settings
Interaction Design/User Experience Design is constantly adapting
•
 New technologies
 New contexts of use
 New understandings of how people function
Multidisciplinary perspective vital
•
The challenge is to apply this to the design of better systems
