HCI and Other Disciplines
Various disciplines
•
work together to create
interfaces that are user-
friendly and efficient
Plays a crucial role in
•
ensuring that the
interaction between
humans and technology
is seamless, efficient,
and enjoyable (Norman,
1988; Shackel, 1990)
Norman, D. A. (1988). The psychology of everyday things. New York: Basic Books 4

User Experience
UX is more important
•
than ever before
Through technology,
•
customers are more
informed than ever before,
and so have higher
expectations
UX will overtake product
•
and price as the key brand
differentiator by the end of
the decade

Why Do IT Developers and
Software Engineers Need HCI?
People have died because software engineers
•
did not understand the people and contexts
their systems were intended to support
Systems can fail for many reasons other than
•
being poorly engineered
Most systems fail for social, not technical
•
reasons
All systems will (somehow) be used by people
•
so understanding users is part of the job of a
developer

NEW PAGE

Why Do IT Developers and Software
Engineers Need HCI?
Because it’s legislated
•
International Organisation
•
for Standardisation (ISO)
standards are
internationally agreed by
experts
 ISO12207:2017 (Software life
cycle processes)
 ISO9241-210:2019 (Human-
centred design processes for
interactive systems)

Ethics
As computing professionals you must act responsibly and
•
consider the wider impact of your work
You must place the interests of the public above those of
•
personal, business or sectional interests
You must strive to enhance the quality of life of those
•
affected by your work

NEW PAGE

Ethics and HCI
HCI research is usually subjected to
•
formal ethical review processes
This is to ensure that participants
•
are being treated with respect and
integrity, and are having their
rights protected
 Abusing the participants can bring
disrepute to the whole research
community
Traditional lab-based experiments
•
are being replaced with more
participatory processes, contextual
and ethnographic methods, and
focus group studies

ACM Code of Ethics
The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code
•
of Ethics is concerned with how fundamental ethical
principles apply to a computing professional's conduct.
Composed of four broad sections:
General Ethical Principles
•
Professional Responsibilities
•
Professional Leadership Principles
•
Compliance with the Code
•
13

NEW PAGE

Ethics in DECO2500/7250
People will be involved in your design activities
•
Treat people with respect
•
Be transparent about the purpose of the research
•
Value their time
•
Protect their identity, data and reputation
•
Give them control over their data
•
14

NEW PAGE

How do we start understanding
people and their needs?
Contextual inquiry
•
 Research methodology that involves in-depth
observation and interviews of a small sample of
users to gain a robust understanding of work
practices and behaviours
Context: Research takes place in the users’
•
natural environment as they conduct their
activities the way they normally would
Inquiry: The researcher watches the user
•
as they perform tasks and asks for
information to understand how and why
users do what they do
15

NEW PAGE

Contextual Inquiry
Can provide richer and more
•
relevant information about how
users complete processes
Allows the researcher to see things
•
you wouldn’t anticipate and uncover
low-level details that have become
habitual and invisible
16

NEW PAGE

Contextual Inquiry
• Observe in the natural • User and researcher are
environment partners in the process
Context Partnership
Focus Interpretation
• Researcher understands • Researcher develops a
the purpose of the shared interpretation for
research project and important aspects of the
what information should work
be sought 17

NEW PAGE

Conducting Contextual Inquiry
Interview people
•
Observations
•
Research existing applications and systems in the
•
domain/topic
Conduct an online survey
•
18

NEW PAGE

Limitations of Surveys
“From this contextual inquiry I chose to make a
behavioural change app that blocks apps to help people
who use their phone too much.”
19

NEW PAGE

Interviews
Generally, there are two types of
•
questions that can be asked during the
contextual inquiry: questions about
current behaviour, and questions about
potential changes
 “Why did you click on this button?” are
behavioural, and they are asked in response
to something a participant did.
 “What would you suggest to add to the
product to make it better?” or, “What did you
like/dislike about this product?” help
participants articulate responses about their
needs or formulate requests for changes.
It’s important to prepare a list of both
•
types of questions for the session

Data Analysis
Bridging the gap between user research
•
raw data and creating personas is one
of the biggest challenges for UX
designers.
Insights, problems, observations, ideas,
•
concerns and pain points need to be
transformed into a concrete format to
be able to understand their users in a
holistic way
Affinity Diagram is a tool that gathers
•
large amounts of language data and
organizes them into groupings based on
their natural relationships

23

NEW PAGE

Affinity Diagrams – Go Physical
Take all data collected and write
•
them down on yellow sticky
notes
Each sticky note must have only
•
one information, insight,
problem or pain point
Make sure to keep a note that
•
reference to the original
transcript or source of
information to return back when
need to (Use U1, U2 & U3 to
refer to your users)
24

NEW PAGE

Affinity Diagrams – Group & Label
Yellow: The building blocks
•
of the affinity diagram, each
yellow note represents a
single observation, idea, pain
point or insight.
Blue: A group of yellow
•
sticky notes (Two to four
notes is the best) grouped
together.
Pink: A higher level groups
•
containing blue sticky notes.
Green: The top level
•
grouping which contains a
group of pink sticky notes.
25

NEW PAGE

Affinity Diagrams – What’s Next?
Finished affinity diagram will give you a holistic view
•
of all the user research you have done and you will be
able to see the full picture
The next step could be building the personas,
•
requirements and user journeys…

28
Don Norman, "The Design of Everyday Things” (Chapter 2)

NEW PAGE

7 Fundamental Principles of Design
Discoverability
•
 Users can determine what actions are possible and the
current state of the system.
29
Don Norman, "The Design of Everyday Things” (Chapter 2) (image: apple.com)

NEW PAGE

7 Fundamental Principles of Design
Feedback
•
 The system immediately communicates the results of a
user’s action, and displays continuous information about its
own state.
30
Don Norman, "The Design of Everyday Things” (Chapter 2) (image: stackoverflow.com)

NEW PAGE

7 Fundamental Principles of Design
Conceptual Model
•
 Describes a holistic understanding of a
system: how it works, how it behaves,
what it does
 The designer’s conceptual model of the
system is a “high-level description of
how a system is organized and
operates”1.
 Conceptual models are revealed
through the patterns of interactive
behaviour designed into a system—how
the system collectively behaves over
time.

7 Fundamental Principles of Design
Affordances
•
 Affordances are the physical possibilities for action an
object provides a user.
 Things like: throw-able, push-able, squeeze-able, turn-able,
twist-able, etc.
 Do not depend on interpretation, meaning, recognition or
understanding. They are just “there”—possibilities for
physical action.
32
Don Norman, "The Design of Everyday Things” (Chapter 2)

NEW PAGE

Interaction Fundamentals – Affordances
Refers to the properties of an object AND the person
•
It’s the relationship between the object and the
•
person and what the person can do with that object
In HCI, affordance is defined as perceivable action
•
possibilities
 Depend on the users’ physical capabilities and their goals
and past experiences
33

NEW PAGE

7 Fundamental Principles of Design
Signifiers
•
 Signifiers are meaning-carriers
 Signs, indicators, signals, icons, animations etc. that can be
interpreted meaningfully
 Act as signs to indicate affordances
34
Don Norman, "The Design of Everyday Things” (Chapter 2)

NEW PAGE

Interaction Fundamentals – Signifiers
Communication “devices” or indicators that tell
•
people what to do and where to do it.
Some sort of indicator, some signal in the physical or
•
social world that can be interpreted meaningfully and
help people understand.

7 Fundamental Principles of Design
Mapping
•
 The relationship between controls and their actions follows
the principles of good mapping, enhanced as much as
possible through spatial layout and temporal contiguity.
40

7 Fundamental Principles of Design
Constraints
•
 Providing physical, logical, semantic, and cultural
constraints guides actions and eases interpretation.

Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
Norman’s (1986) “Seven
•
Stages of the Action Cycle”
composes interactions into
steps
Each step may be well or
•
poorly supported.
45
Don Norman, "The Design of Everyday Things” (Chapter 2)

NEW PAGE

Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
The gulfs are two sources of difficulty when interacting
•
with a machine or system. They occur due to issues with
discoverability and feedback.
Gulf of Execution
•
 Difference between the user’s formulation of actions to reach a
goal and actions allowed by system
 If the actions allowed by a system match the user’s intention,
then interaction will be effective
Gulf of Evaluation
•
 Distance between physical presentation of system state and
expectations of the user
 If a user can readily evaluate presentation in terms of goals, the
gulf of evaluation is small
46

NEW PAGE

Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
How do I work out
the right thing to
do?
How do I work out
what the system
did?
47
Norman (1986)

NEW PAGE

Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
The interaction starts with the person having a goal
•
that they want to accomplish
48

NEW PAGE

Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
The Gulf of Execution is the gulf between a person’s
•
goal and the means of achieving that goal
49

NEW PAGE

Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
The Gulf of Evaluation is the gulf between assessing
•
the state of the world (the system) and determining if
that state matches the person’s goal.
50

Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation

or questions that people work through…

NEW PAGE

Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
We don’t always follow this sequentially - but tend to jump backwards and forwards
•
Some steps are not conscious (even goal setting)
•
Problems can arise at any step in the sequence - even with the user’s goal (not having
•
a clear understanding of what they are wanting to do)
59

NEW PAGE

Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
It is a useful tool to evaluate interactions and

systems
60

AND there are many other factors that impact on an

interaction, which we will cover in the future

is…It depends
62

NEW PAGE

Assessment and Feedback
This course will give you an opportunity to use/apply
•
HCI theories & methods in the context of a specific
design context (the project in the studios)
There are very few questions with absolute
•
right/wrong answers, but there are always
better/worse ones.
 Wicked problems
 Requires interpretation, judgement (and in the design
context) rationale for decisions
63

NEW PAGE

Summary
User experience is an important aspect of the design
•
process that should not be overlooked
As computing professionals, you have a responsibility
•
to act maturely and consider the wider impact of your
work
The seven-stage model of the action cycle is a
•
valuable design tool that provides a basic checklist of
questions to ask when designing software
Designers can support their users by being aware of
•
the gulfs and bridging them
