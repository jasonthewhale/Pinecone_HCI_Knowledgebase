The Fidelity Continuum
“Design methods are not
•
mutually exclusive. Rather,
each method exists on a
continuum of fidelity,”
uxBooth
There’s a balance that needs
•
to be established between
time, resources and fidelity
The optimal level of fidelity
•
is the minimum amount of
fidelity needed to get the job
done

Prototyping
Low-fidelity: quick and simple way of evolving
•
an initial idea
 Goal is to outline the flow and to check the
usefulness and usability of your proposed
functionality
 Paper prototypes
• Click-through prototypes
High-fidelity: More advanced, with their
•
aesthetics and functions and far closer to that of
the final product
• Created further along in the process once a team
has a firm grasp of what they want the finished
product to embody, using prototyping software
• Generally used for usability testing with real users
or to get final design approval from stakeholders
• Digital, code-free prototypes
• Coded prototypes

Prototyping Software Tools
Software Tools such as (Adobe XD, Figma, InVision

…etc. )
Common Features:
•
 Create Interfaces
 Vector drawing/graphic design tools
 A way to manage ‘screens’
 Create Interactions
 A way to connect buttons and UI elements with other screens
 Support Feedback
 One or more ways to share or test the created prototype.

Interaction Flow Diagrams
Interaction (IX) Flow Diagrams provide a visualization that is
•
made up of all the screens of your system that are connected with
lines and arrows to illustrate how the user interacts with the
system
Like the lines of a flowchart, the direction of the arrow following
•
the function of the shape indicates the flow of interaction
If there are decisions in the system, a diamond symbol can be
•
added
Each flow change from one task to another is explained through
•
separate text outside the frame
The thoroughness of the IX Flow can be intimidating, but
•
communicating these interactions has many benefits:
 Centralizes the flow, visual design, and interactions in one document
 Can be exported as a PDF, JPEG, etc. so this document can be viewed
on any desktop
 Reduces guesswork and ambiguity on the developer’s part
9
 Reduces mistakes during development

When microinteractions are well

designed, they help us navigate,
instructs us on how to use technology,
prevents us from making errors, and
ultimately engages us and keeps us
engaged
Design isn’t just aesthetics. It’s a

Cognitive Load Theory
Cognitive load = the amount of information that working
•
memory can hold at one time
Cognitive Load Theory, developed by Sweller (1988),
•
builds on the information processing model (below),
developed by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968)

Information Processing Model: Memory
We encode, store and then retrieve knowledge

We remember what we have attended to

Context is an important cue to memory retrieval

We recognize things better than we recall things

Sensation and Perception
Sensation = capacity to have a physical feeling or
•
awareness by receiving information from environmental
stimuli through our senses
Perception = becoming aware of, organizing, and
•
interpreting this information so that it makes sense to us
22

NEW PAGE

Perception and Recognition
Perception is the sensory
•
experience of the world
Involves both recognizing
•
environmental stimuli and
actions in response to these
stimuli
It is also necessary for the
•
brain to categorize and
interpret what you are sensing
Recognition is the ability to
•
interpret and give meaning to
the object

Learning
Design implications for learning include:
•
 Interfaces should encourage exploration
 Whilst also constraining and guiding users to select
appropriate actions when they are initially learning
 Particular representations and abstract concepts should be
dynamically linked to allow the learning of complex
material

Reading, Speaking and Listening

 Speech-output systems

information that is easily
accessible for those who want to
go deeper
 Simple and memorable functions

on the move

Cognitive Diversity
Designing for cognitive diversity is the
•
foundation for the future of work, regardless
of industry
As technology expands, we must consider
•
what it means to create experiences that
adapt to people and context, and create
along the emotional and functional spectrum
 What kind and what level of cognitive demands
do our experiences place on our users?
 Are there some types of cognitive demands that
are especially heavy, and if so do we support
different needs around capabilities like focus
and attention?
 Do we support many ways for people to be at
their best, or just the ones that mirror our own
needs?

Nudging and Dark Patterns
Dark patterns are deceptive aspects of an
•
interface that have been designed carefully in
order to deliberately trick people
 E.g. signing up for email alerts
 Smaller text, different colours, etc.
Dark patterns often go undetected by the
•
average person as they play upon cognitive
biases that we all have without realizing it
Nudging describes how users can be led
•
toward making certain choices by appealing to
psychological biases
 E.g. smaller short-term rewards over long-term
gains
@darkpatterns
Often a website’s design nudges users towards
•
a specific option (usually the more expensive)
and distracts them from other options (e.g.
standard) 63

•
following points about the investigation:
 “Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive
interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including
teenagers and children,”
 “Fortnite’s counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing
button configuration led players to incur unwanted
charges based on the press of a single button”
 “Players could, for example, be charged while trying to
wake the game from sleep mode, while the game was in a
loading screen, or by pressing a nearby button when
simply trying to preview an item”
 “These tactics led to hundreds of millions of dollars in
unauthorized charges for consumers”

Are Dark Patterns Illegal?
The use of dark patterns is not by default illegal
•
 It depends how the dark pattern is applied
Online businesses need to be persuasive to consumers (to a degree), but
•
dark patterns risk breaching both data protection and consumer laws
and so should be used with caution
“More than eight in 10 Australians (83%) have lost money, lost control
•
of their data or have been manipulated by a business to make a choice
that isn't in their interest” Consumer Policy Research Centre (CPRC)
In Australia some dark patterns may be in breach of consumer
•
protections, including (choice.com.au):
• Misleading or deceptive conduct if businesses create a misleading or
deceptive impression about their product or service
• Unfair contract terms where there is limited opportunity to negotiate with a
business and where a term may pose significant imbalance or detriment, or
where there is a lack of transparency
• Patterns that breach privacy protections under the Privacy Act 1988 to
protect the privacy of personal information.

Summary
Cognition involves several processes, including memory,
•
perception and learning
The way an interface is designed can greatly affect how well
•
users can perceive, attend, learn and remember how to do their
tasks
Theoretical frameworks provide ways of understanding how
•
and why people interact with products
Cognition is distributed among individuals, the environment,
•
and various artefacts
When designing for new technology it is important to
•
determine its acceptance as new interaction contexts are
emerging, which open new challenges to the user (cognitive
limitations)
