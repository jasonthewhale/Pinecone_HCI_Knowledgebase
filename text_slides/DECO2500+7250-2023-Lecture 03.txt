Looking Beyond The GE&E
Why we need to consider humans
“Is it that the system doesn’t work, or that it just
doesn’t work for people?”

Looking Beyond The GE&E
Culture – what is a reasonable answer to a question with a
mistaken premise?
Lived Experience
Human Values
Mental Models – what was expected to happen?
Cognition – what is understood to be happening?
Perception – what is seen to be happening?
Attention – what is being focused on?
Emotion – what state of mind? stressed? tired?
Social
Temporal – what just happened prior? how does that matter
now?

Diversity of People – Culture
“Culture is the collective programming of the mind
•
which distinguishes the members of one group from
another” – G. Hofstede & G.J. Hofstede (2005),
Cultures and Organisations: Software of the mind
Culture can have an influence on:
•
 Learning styles National
Culture
 Attitudes to change
 Expectations, assumptions
 Aesthetic taste
Personal Corporate
Culture Culture
 Judgment
 Perception
15

NEW PAGE

Diversity of People – Culture
“Culture” is not often solely or primarily responsible for
•
many important differences
A focus on users’ culture can also invite incorrect, and
•
damaging, stereotypes
Culture is an important consideration because it requires
•
designers to identify their own culturally-based
assumptions about what they consider to be ‘normal’ or
‘obvious', not because it provides a shortcut for grouping
large cultural groups together as the ‘same’. Many
cultural stereotypes are inaccurate.
When we design, we have to see our own culture.

Diversity of People – Lived Experience
“Personal knowledge about the world gained through direct, first-

hand involvement in everyday events rather than through
representations constructed by other people” – Oxford Reference
Experience that is embedded in a ‘natural’ or ‘real’ context of use
•
Incorporates people’s perceptions of those experiences – the

meaning that they attribute to the experience

Diversity of People – Human Values
What’s important to people:
•
 Guiding principles e.g. justice, security, freedom,
community, individuality, responsibility/duty…
 Something we cherish e.g. spending time with friends,
personal privacy, self-improvement…
 You'll need to this when you analyse your
interviews...
Privacy vs Distrust vs
Discount? Connection?

Identifying Human Values
What’s important to people:
•
The quote (next slide) comes from an interview from
•
a teacher talking about how new measurement
technologies change the way children “do” science at
primary school. When studying water quality,
children used to have to take a physical sample of
water from the creek, identify its colour from a chart,
perform chemical (litmus) tests to find its pH levels
etc. Now they have a device they can stick in the
water and get the readings:

Identifying Human Values
“It [the old way] is fun for the kids and I think doing
•
that hands-on gives them a better appreciation of
what they are doing and what they are seeing,
experiencing it, whereas when you just put a device
in water and pull it out, that tells you what it is. You
really don’t have a great understanding of what it is,
‘oh, I am reading salinity, um I am reading density
and I am reading turbidity and I am reading oxygen
levels’, but what does that really mean?…”

Identifying Human Values
How do we design systems that support values?
•
Read your interviews not just for what they say or
•
what their opinions are, but for what values you can
identify from the points they make, the things they
call out as being important, and reasons they give.
25

NEW PAGE

Mental Models
Refers to a user’s underlying expectations about how something should work
•
Based on their existing experiences with what people perceive as similar
•
interactions or systems or by assumptions they’ve made based on how it appears
(perceived affordances)
Allows people to reason about a system to determine how it works and to predict
•
the behaviour of a system or application including how to recover from errors
A user’s mental model is constantly evolving and subject to change due to
•
influences by new experiences with the product, other technologies, and day to day
life

Forming Mental Models
• A critical method of obtaining answers
Observation about our general surroundings
• Users update their mental models based
on additional experience with the system
– Don Norman
Mental

• All design is cultural. If you aren’t
identifying your own cultural
assumptions, don’t expect users to Culture

The same human issues also apply to designers and

be around how the user understands the world

Conceptual Design
Going from a great idea to a fully functioning app or
•
system is a long process that involves many steps,
such as UI design and functional testing
Before any development starts, it’s important to have
•
a clear picture of what is being created

an abstraction outlining what

people can do with a product

Conceptual Design
This is a “manifestation”:
A conceptual design is the part

of an interaction design containing
a theme, notion, or idea with the
purpose of communicating a design
vision about a system or product
A conceptual design is the

… and so is this:
manifestation of the designer’s

design that brings the designer’s
mental model to life within the

requirements (aims, desires and functionality) into

as a user interface
 It is the concepts that people need to understand in order to
use the interface.

System concept statement
A structured, clear, and updated explanation of what your
system is and what it does.
Created from design directions and outcomes from
analysing all data from user inquiry.
It has 5 parts:
48

NEW PAGE

System concept statement example
In this example, we use one data point, but you will need
to synthesise many insights, design directions and
outcomes to do this step.
The domain that has been chosen is behaviour change
and the particular topic is a problem with saving
money.
The first step is to truly understand the nature of the
problem.
49

NEW PAGE

System concept statement example
From our interviews, we may have identified the following statement
and included it into our affinity diagram:
“I get bored on weekends, trying to find something to do. So I talk to
my housemates and we decided to go to the city just to wander
around. But I always end up shopping and buying something with
the money that I intended to save.”
Breaking this down, the issues might be:
● Being bored on a weekend
● Choosing the city as a place to spend idle time
● When in the city, they end up shopping
● If they go shopping, they end up buying things
Should we focus on all of these issues or just one?
50

NEW PAGE

System concept statement example
We can then choose to focus on one aspect of this issue:
when in the city, they end up shopping.
By focusing on this aspect of the problem, we can then
propose a solution:
51

NEW PAGE

System concept statement example
From the same information, we can see that they also express some
human values:
● Finding interesting things to do
● Enjoying the city as a place to be
● Being social with friends
There are possibly some other issues that also need to be considered that
are general concerns or interests, for example:
● Having fun
● Being careful of data usage on their phone
● Personal tastes of what they find enjoyable
From these things we can start to construct key bits of information that
need to be taken into account when developing a solution. Other aspects of
the original interview quote could also be considered for a different
solution.
52

NEW PAGE

System concept statement example
From this information we can then start to construct the
one sentence problem statement. This is what the one
sentence problem statement might look like:
53

NEW PAGE

System concept statement example
The next thing we need to add is a high-level description
of how the system works, which is an idealised view of
how the system might work for example:

c.
The level of support and/or desired experience
d.

Design guidelines (AKA design principles)
“A UX, or interaction, design
guideline is a statement suggesting
recommendations and
considerations to inform the design
of a specific aspect or component of
interaction in a certain context.
Some design guidelines come from
study data, but most come from
principles, maxims, and experience.
(UX Book, Chapter 22)”
Examples are:
Apple Human Interface
●
Guidelines
Design for Android

System requirements statements
Each system requirement statement is a ‘card’ that
describes a feature for an outcome.
Each has a description of the requirement, and the
insights and data points that justify why it is necessary.

Summary
The Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation (GE&E) help us
•
to design an interaction, understand where things may
go wrong, and point to areas for solutions.
A mental model is a person’s model (thoughts) about:
•
how to interact with a system and how that system
works
Both users and designers have mental models about a
•
system.
Conceptual Design is created by the designer as a high-
•
level plan for how the system will work and fit together
Made up of different elements that shape the
•
organisation of the system
63

Next Time…
In our next session, we will continue delving into the
•
human issues that impact on interaction and look at
