Task Analysis
After knowing the users and their goals, tasks should be
•
identified
Tasks need to be performed by the user to achieve the
•
goal (the desired final result)
Task analysis helps us with better understanding of:
•
 goals
 what users actually do step by step to achieve the goal
 how people perform their tasks
 their priorities, preferences and intentions
 task flow, frequencies and sequences
Task analysis is not just a pre-design process and can be
•
done for an existing system

NEW PAGE

Hierchical Task Analysis
Hierarchical Task Analysis is a popular task analysis technique
•
It is used to represent decomposition of tasks and subtasks
•
Tasks are clustered into plans and each plan groups the subtasks
•
The diagram includes the hierarchy, subtasks, and the plans
•
Plans describe the order and constraints, and the type of plan
•

Plans in HTA
Plans are important to explain the hierarchy, flow and relationships
•
Different types of plans:
•
 Fixed sequence
 E.g. do 1.1 then 1.2 then 1.3
 Optional tasks
 E.g if the pot is full, do 2
 Wait for events
 E.g. wait for the kettle to boil 1.4
 Cycles
 E.g. do 5.1 - 5.3 for each guest
 Time-sharing
 E.g. do 1; at the same time if the pot is full do 2
 Discretionary
 E.g. do 3.2 and 3.3 in any order
Mixtures combine several of the above

UX Goals
High-level objectives, in terms of
•
anticipated user experience
Can be driven by business goals
•
 Reflect real use of a product
 Identify what is important to an
organisation, its customers, and its
users
Expressed as desired effects to
•
be experienced in use

Measuring UX Goals
What is it you are going to
•
measure?
 Objective (directly measurable)
 Initial performance
 Long-term performance
 Learnability
 Retainability
 Advanced feature usage
 Subjective (based on opinions)
 First impression
 Long-term satisfaction

measure it?
 ‘Measuring instruments’
 Benchmark tests
 User satisfaction questionnaires

UX Metrics
Metrics are indicators that
•
show whether your UX
strategy is working
Objective/performance-
•
oriented
 Taken while participants are
doing a benchmark task
Subjective
•
 Based on a rating or score from
questionnaire results

Examples of UX Metrics
Percentage of task completed in a timed task
Ratio of successes to failures
Time spent moving cursor
Fixations on the screen to assess cognitive load

Focus on Outcomes not Features
An output is a product or
•
service that you create
An outcome is the problem
•
that you solve with that
product
A feature is something a
•
product or service offers
A benefit is what customers
•
actually want

S.M.A.R.T. User Goals
Specific
• Precisely states what needs to be accomplished
Measurable
• Qualitatively or quantitatively
Actionable • Specific goal leads to identification of content
or functionality that satisfies it
Relevant • Appropriate for the level of interaction being
focused on
Trackable • Over time in order to evaluate immediate and
longer term success

Let’s think about measuring experience:

Go to menti.com and enter 4644 2901
Imagine a government wants to know
which of its hospitals achieve the best
patient health outcomes, so it can study
their practices, reward them, give those
hospitals more money and resources,
and create better standards for best
practice.
What simple metric can it collect
to get this information?

User Stories
In UX industry, “user stories”
•
are simple grammatical
sentences that encapsulate UX
goals in the following format:
As a [type of user]
•
I want to [take an action]
•
So that [a positive outcome]
•

Ethical Treatment of Participants
Institutional approval from independent body representing scientific and community standards
•
(can be waived for low risk educational projects).
(In an organisation) Agreements about who gets to see employee data and when, and who does
•
not.
Informed consent read and signed before data collected
•
Participants have a right to know:
•
 The goals of the study
 What they will be asked to do and how long their involvement will last
 The possible risks (aim for minimal risk)
 What will happen to the research findings and who will see them
 How their personal information and data will be stored and who has access (privacy concerns)
 That they will not be quoted without their agreement
 That they can leave when they wish without hindrance or questioning
 That they will be treated politely and with respect…
Focus:
•
 “We’re understanding the world you work/play/live in”
36
 “The software is being tested, not you!”

User Evaluations
User evaluations can
•
help designers uncover
how users perceive a
system before, during
and after interacting
with it
Evaluations often only
•
give you part of the
story.
 They give you the “what”
but NOT the “why”

•
that relate back to requirements gathered from your
users
They need to be SMART
•
They keep your design and engineering effort
•
grounded in what is important for success
User evaluations should be completed multiple times
•
throughout the development process
